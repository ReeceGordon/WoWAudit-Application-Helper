# WoWAudit-Application-Helper
Used to help manage applications sent to your WoWAudit applications.

This app is useful because the [WoW Audit](https://wowaudit.com/) applications interface forces a Battle.net authentication reload each time you make a change to an application and has no filtering to change the list view of applications. This small app is massively faster for mass deletions and filtering applications to be deleted.

The date filter is hard set to applications older than 90 days from the current date, will consider adding a date selector in future.

## Usage
Copy your api key from https://wowaudit.com/eu/*REALM-NAME*/*GUILD-NAME*/*TEAM-NAME*/api and paste it into this tool, set your key with the set button and you're good to go.

Replace *REALM-NAME* *GUILD-NAME* *TEAM-NAME* with your respective wow audit names.
